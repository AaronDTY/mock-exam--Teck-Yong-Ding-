    "During this exercise, I strictly applied the **Week 5 AI Partnership Guidelines** by explicitly constraining AI responses to use only concepts through Week 8. When AI suggested using advanced exception handling like custom exception classes, I modified the suggestions to match our **Week 6 basic try-except structures**. This ensured my code reflected genuine course progression rather than AI's advanced knowledge. I consistently referenced specific weeks when requesting AI assistance, maintaining academic integrity while leveraging AI as a learning tool rather than a replacement for understanding.\n",

    "This exercise closely connected to our **Week 7 File Processing Assignment** and **Week 8 Data Validation Project**. I found the **Week 6 error handling concepts** most useful, particularly handling file-not-found scenarios. Compared to my earlier debugging approach in the **Week 3 Logic Exercises**, I now systematically validate inputs and handle edge cases, reflecting skill development from **Week 2 basic lists** to **Week 8 data structure validation**. The progression from basic conditional logic to comprehensive defensive programming is clearly evident in my implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skill Development (60 words):\n",
    "Based on this practice, I will focus on **Week 8 defensive programming concepts** for the real exam. I need to improve code structure and organization skills, ensuring my functions are both robust and readable in preparation for **Week 10 maintainable code requirements**. Specifically, I want to strengthen my ability to balance comprehensive error handling with clean, understandable code architecture for future programming assignments.\n",
